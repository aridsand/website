abstract = "Biological homeostasis invokes modulatory responses aimed at stabilizing internal conditions. Using tunable photo- and mechano-stimulation, we identified two distinct categories of homeostatic responses during the sleep-like state of *Caenorhabditis elegans* (lethargus). In the presence of weak or no stimuli, extended motion caused a subsequent extension of quiescence. The neuropeptide Y receptor homolog, NPR-1, and an inhibitory neuropeptide known to activate it, FLP-18, were required for this process. In the presence of strong stimuli, the correlations between motion and quiescence were disrupted for several minutes but homeostasis manifested as an overall elevation of the time spent in quiescence. This response to strong stimuli required the function of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor in neurons, but not that of NPR-1. Conversely, response to weak stimuli did not require the function of DAF-16/FOXO. These findings suggest that routine homeostatic stabilization of sleep may be distinct from homeostatic compensation following a strong disturbance."
abstract_short = "Disrupting nematode sleep revealed two distinct homeostatic behaviors depending on whether the stimulus was strong or weak. I found distinct molecular pathways and cells that regulate these behaviors: neuropeptide signaling through the neuropeptide-Y receptor homolog NPR-1 was needed for a brief extension of quiescence following weak stimuli. I later found that NPR-1 is needed only in the RMG neurons for this behavior to occur (data not shown in paper). In contrast, the stress-activated transcription factor DAF-16 in the insulin/IGF-1 pathway was needed in neurons for a sustained elevation in quiescence following strong stimuli."
